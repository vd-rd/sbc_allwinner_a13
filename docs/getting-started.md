== Getting started with your board

To get started you'll need the following:
* a microUSB cable and a power supply
* a microSD card loaded with the necessary firmware

You can connect additional expansion boards that can provide additional functionality, for example:
* a AC-DC board so you can use the board directly from a mains line
* a LCD board that can provide I/O

== Load firmware on the microSD

To flash an image on the card, you can either go for a prebuilt image, or consult the software section for advanced instructions and configuration.
